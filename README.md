# VBA_List

The idea is to build own class for VBA List. Currently, I am using the one from here http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/1072196/A-Simple-List-Class-for-VBA-Projects

The following is added/changed:
 - All integers are changed to long;
 - Removed "Option Compare database", so it works in Excel;
 - I fixed the indentation and the spacing between rows the way I like it;
 - I changed the code, so it always has the declaration of the variables in top;
 - Added a sample TestSample, printing what it needs to;
 - Changed the name of the class to "cls_vbaList"
